This repository contains various files related to the Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Network (SCAN) project. Below is an overview of its contents:

## **Forms**

### **Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Network Alignment Questionnaire.md**
This markdown file contains the **Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Network Alignment Questionnaire (SCANAQ)**, which evaluates various aspects of a user's cognitive functioning and personal preferences to align the SCAN system with their unique needs.

#### **Sections of the Questionnaire:**
- Executive Functioning
- Emotion Regulation
- Impulsivity
- Risk Propensity
- Decision-Making Style
- Self-Efficacy
- Perceived Stress
- Empathy and Social Cognition

### **Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Network Alignment Questionnaire (SCANAQ).pdf**
PDF version of the SCANAQ questionnaire for easy distribution and printing.

### **SCANAQ Numerical Scoring Breakdown.md**
This file provides detailed information on **scoring and result interpretation** for the SCANAQ questionnaire.  

#### **Details:**
- **Scoring Breakdown**: A structured approach to categorize responses across cognitive and emotional dimensions.
- **Result Interpretation**: Guidelines to understand the user's profile and align it with the SCAN system for personalized support.
- **Suggestions**: Offers actionable recommendations for improvement based on each score range, enhancing user alignment with SCAN's functionality.

### **SCANAQ Scoring Breakdown, Descriptions, and PFC-Inspired Suggestions.pdf**
PDF version of the scoring breakdown with comprehensive descriptions and prefrontal cortex-inspired suggestions for cognitive enhancement.

### **Cognitive Augmentation User Survey Evaluation.md**
This markdown file contains the **Cognitive Augmentation User Survey Evaluation (CAUSE)**, designed to gather user insights to help improve the SCAN system to meet their needs and expectations.

#### **Survey Focus Areas:**
1. **General User Requirements and Expectations**
   - Desired use cases and applications
   - Preferred features and functionalities
2. **Perceived Value and Potential Benefits**
   - User perceptions of SCAN's value and its role in cognitive augmentation.
3. **User Interface and Experience Preferences**
   - Insights into technological proficiency and current tool usage.
   - Accessibility and interface design recommendations.
4. **Pain Points and Challenges**
   - Identification of areas where users face difficulties.
5. **Security and Privacy Concerns**
   - Gathering user preferences on data security and privacy policies.
6. **Demographics and Pricing Perception**
   - Understanding user demographics and their views on pricing.

## **Training Datasets**

This directory contains **JSON lines files** for training and validation data related to different PFC (Prefrontal Cortex) agents:

### **Available Datasets:**
1. **ACC (Anterior Cingulate Cortex):**
   - `TrainingDatasets/acc_training_data.jsonl`
   - `TrainingDatasets/acc_validation_data.jsonl`
2. **DLPFC (Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex):**
   - `TrainingDatasets/dlpfc_training_data.jsonl`
   - `TrainingDatasets/dlpfc_validation_data.jsonl`
3. **mPFC (Medial Prefrontal Cortex):**
   - `TrainingDatasets/mPFC_training_data.jsonl`
   - `TrainingDatasets/mPFC_validation_data.jsonl`
4. **OFC (Orbitofrontal Cortex):**
   - `TrainingDatasets/ofc_training_data.jsonl`
   - `TrainingDatasets/ofc_validation_data.jsonl`
5. **vmPFC (Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex):**
   - `TrainingDatasets/vmpfc_training_data.jsonl`
   - `TrainingDatasets/vmpfc_validation_data.jsonl`

Each dataset is designed to train and validate SCAN's cognitive agents to align their functionality with the corresponding areas of the human brain.
